# E-wish
<strong>E-wish</strong> is a project to send wishes to family and loved ones. No Registration required!! Just add the fields and a link is made, ready to be sent to the recipients. Currently it is built in Flask (for Backend) and some HTML, CSS (for Frontend). Later on there will be more added into it. Also it is self hosted on a raspberry pi !! So what are you waiting for go to the <a href="" target="_blank">site</a> and send some wishes ;) (Fun Fact: It is harder than what i expected to self host it :(  )

Thanks to <a href="https://uiverse.io/ammarsaa/chatty-firefox-25" target="_blank">@ammarsaa</a> for the UI code from UIVERCE. It was super helpful.
